            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is an open source distributed version control system that is free to use. It has been designed to be capable of handling everything from small to very large project in an efficient and speedy manner. Git is not very hard to use, and it provides the users with very fast performance. It outperforms other tools like Subversion, Perforce, ClearCase and CVS. Some of its outperforming features include cheap local branching, multiple workflows, and staging areas. Git is able to store and think about information in different ways than the other tools, it thinks of its data like a series of snapshots of a small filesystem. With Git, every time you commit, or save the state of your project, Git basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control systems or VCS is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large websites and other collections of information. These changes that are made are usually identified by a number or a letter code. These are called revision numbers, revision levels, or just revisions. There has always been a need to organize and control revisions for as long as writing has existed. This became much more important and way more complicated when the age of computing began.  Version control systems usually run as standalone applications, but it is also embedded in various types of software such as word processors and spreadsheets. Revision control allows users to revert to previously revisions which is very important for editors that need to track each other’s edits.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is comprised of three main states that your files can be in, committed, modified, and staged. When a file is in the committed stage that means that the data has been safely stored into your local database. The database is located in the Git directory, which stores the metadata and object database of the whole project. It is what you push or clone a repository to or from another computer. When Git is in the modified state this means that the file has been changed but not committed to the Git database yet. The modified file is in the working directory where it's a single checkout of one version of the project. These files are pulled out of the compressed database in the Git directory and placed on a disk for you to use or modify. The last state is Staged where the file has been marked in the current version and will go into the next commit snapshot. The staged file has snapshots which is then stored in the staging area, where it's a file and where it will store information about what will go into your next commit. It's sometimes referred to as the 'index', but it's also common to refer to it as the staging area. It is contained in your Git directory.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Everything that is inside of Git is check summed before it is able to be stored and it is then referred to by that same check sum. It is impossible to change the contents or information of any file or directory without the Git noticing.  This system is built into Git itself at its lowest levels and it is a vital part of it philosophy. A user will not lose any information in transit or a get a corrupted file without Git noticing it. The mechanism it uses is called SHA-1 hash and it is a 40 character string that is composed of hexadecimal characters and is calculated based on the contents of a specific file or structured directory.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Gits File Movement</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Unlike many other VCS systems, Git does not track file movement. When a user renames a file inside of Git, none of the metadata is stored inside of the system. Git does have an mv command however and it does work but it is also the same as running it as through the rm and add commands. Git figures out that it’s a rename so it doesn’t really matter if you happen to rename a file with that way or with the mv command. The only difference is that git mv is one command instead of three. It is a function that is made for convenience.</p>
